I remember long ago another starry night like this\nIn the firelight Fernando. You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar\nI could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar\n\nThey were closer now Fernando. Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally\nI was so afraid Fernando. We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die\nAnd I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry\n\n  There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando\n  They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando\n  Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret\n  If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando\n  If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando\n\nNow we're old and grey Fernando. And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand\nCan you hear the drums Fernando? Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?\nI can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land\n\nChorus",

Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.\nI got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.\n\nLife is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.\nNever start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.\nTake a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.\nLove is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.\nIt all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served\nLove's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot\n\n  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that\n\nWhy I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.\nI don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.\nFuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.\nLet the lovin' come back to me\n\nChorus",

What did I know?\nThose days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but\n\nChorus",
