saw a shimmering light<br>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br><br>There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>And I was thinking to myself, \"This could be heaven or this could be hell\"<br>Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br><br>  Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>  Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br><br>Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br><br>So I called up the Captain, \"Please bring me my wine\"<br>He said, \"We haven't had that spirit here since 1969\"<br>And still those voices are calling from far away<br>Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br><br>  Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>  They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br><br>Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>And she said: \"We are all just prisoners here, of our own device\"<br>And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br><br>Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>\"Relax\" said the night man \"We are
