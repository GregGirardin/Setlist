They say the danger has gone away\nBut I can see the fire's still alight Burning into the night.\n\n  There's too many men, too many people making too many problems\n  And there's not much love to go around\n  Can't you see this is the land of confusion?\n\n    This is the world we live in and these are the hands we're given\n    Use them and let's start trying to make it a place worth living in\n\nOh, superman, where are you now? When everything's gone wrong somehow?\nThe men of steel, these men of power Are losing control by the hour.\n\n  And this is the time, this is the place so we look for the future\n  But there's not much love to go around\n  Tell me why this is the land of confusion\n\nChorus\n\nI remember long ago when the sun was shining,\nAnd all the stars were bright, all through the night,\nIn the wake up this madness, as I held you tight. So long ago.\n\nI won't be coming home tonight my generation will put it right\nWe're not just making promises that we know we'll never keep\n\n  There's too many men, too many people making too many problems\n  And there's not much love to go around\n  Can't you see this is the land of confusion?\n\nChorus",

Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.\nNever start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.\nTake a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.\nLove is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.\nIt all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served\nLove's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot\n\n  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that\n\nWhy I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.\nI don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.\nFuckin' and fightin it's all the same.
